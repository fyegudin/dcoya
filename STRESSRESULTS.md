### Stress Test Proposal

#### Objective:
The objective of the stress test is to evaluate the performance and stability of the web application under high load
conditions. This test aims to identify any bottlenecks, performance degradation, or system failures that may occur when
the system is subjected to a large number of concurrent users or requests.

#### Tools:
For conducting the stress test, we will utilize Apache JMeter, a widely-used open-source load testing tool.
Apache JMeter provides robust features for creating and executing load tests, generating performance metrics,
and analyzing test results.

#### Methodology:
1. **Test Scenario Identification**: Identify the critical user scenarios and functionalities of the web application to be included in the stress test. These scenarios should represent typical user interactions such as login, browsing, posting, commenting, etc.

2. **Test Plan Creation**: Develop a comprehensive test plan outlining the test objectives, scenarios, workload model, and success criteria. Define the number of concurrent users, ramp-up period, duration of the test, and target performance metrics (e.g., response time, throughput, error rate).

3. **Test Script Creation**: Create JMeter test scripts to simulate user behavior and execute the identified test scenarios. Record user actions using JMeter's HTTP(S) Test Script Recorder or manually create scripts based on the application's API endpoints.

4. **Workload Configuration**: Configure the workload model in JMeter to generate the desired load on the application. Define the number of virtual users, distribution of requests, and pacing between requests to simulate realistic user behavior.

5. **Test Execution**: Execute the stress test according to the defined test plan. Monitor system resources (CPU, memory, network) and application performance metrics during the test to identify any abnormalities or performance issues.

6. **Results Analysis**: Analyze the test results generated by JMeter to evaluate the application's performance under stress. Review key performance indicators such as response time, throughput, error rate, and system resource utilization.

7. **Performance Tuning**: Identify any performance bottlenecks or areas for improvement based on the test results. Implement optimizations or architectural changes to enhance the application's scalability and performance.

#### Results Verification:
- **Response Time Distribution**: Verify that the response time distribution remains within acceptable limits for different user scenarios and concurrency levels. Anomalies such as spikes or excessive response times should be investigated.

- **Throughput and Error Rate**: Verify that the application can sustain the expected throughput under high load conditions without a significant increase in error rates. Ensure that error responses are properly handled and logged.

- **System Resource Utilization**: Monitor the utilization of CPU, memory, and network resources during the test to ensure that the application and underlying infrastructure can handle the load effectively. Identify any resource bottlenecks that may impact performance.

- **Scalability Assessment**: Evaluate the application's scalability by gradually increasing the load (e.g., doubling the number of concurrent users) and monitoring performance metrics. Determine the point at which the application starts to exhibit degradation or failure.

#### Conclusion:
The stress test provides valuable insights into the performance and scalability of the web application under extreme load conditions. By identifying and addressing performance bottlenecks, the application can be optimized to deliver a seamless user experience and handle future growth in user traffic.
